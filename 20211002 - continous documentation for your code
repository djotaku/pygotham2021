One way of doing documentation is a problem-oriented approach or How-To Guides

Also, writing a tutorial helps users understand how to use your code

Understanding-oriented approach - explanation

Explain why the code is doing some of the things it's doing

This helps you gain more contributors

Documentation is great because you might forget something you need to know about this project

But also to be more welcoming to new devs on the project

Make sure it's always up to date
