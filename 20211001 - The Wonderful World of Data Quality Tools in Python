Rather than the "six dimensions", this talk is about

    - Profiling
    - Documentation/lineage
    - Validation/testing
    - Version control - keeps a record of changes and the ability to do a rollback
    - Cleaning
    
This talk is an overview of Python tools to help in this space. 

The speaker decided to focus on individual tools rather than any end-to-end tools.

For profiling:

    - Pandas "describe" - gives you basic stats of the numeric values in your dataframe
    - Pandas Profiling - gives a more detailed version of the above
    
Validation/Testing
    - Bulwark - lets you add tests on methods tha return Pandas dataframes. It also has built-in tests
    - Engarde - older version of Bulwark
    - Voluptous - you can validate JSON/YAML
    - Opulent Pandas - like above, but df-focused - instead of JSON it uses pandas dataframes
    - mobydq - has a webapp 
    - TDDA - 
    - pydqc - compares columns between tables and tables for identity
    - Great Expectations - you can write declarative data tests (I expect this table to have between x and y number of rows) and validate teh results of those tests

Data version control
    - dvc - it's built on top of git and made specifically for data and Machine Learning models
    
Data cleaning
    - dedupe - uses fuzzy matching to perform data deduplication
    - dataclearner - cleasn data frames (like drop rows with missing values)
    - pyjanitor
    
Then the speaker presents some demos!
