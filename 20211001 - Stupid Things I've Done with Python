Stupid things I've Done With Python

1 == True and 0 == False

"True" == True is True

"False" == True is True. What?!? (just kidding, this makes sense)

what he wants is 

"True" == True-ish is True and "False" == True-ish is False

This demonstrates the __eq__ method

But then the __rsub__ method because to make True-ish the Python interpreter thinks you're subtracting ish from True.
