Be sure to think about the version of Python you will support because it determines the features you can use.

you can pip install pyupgrade to change your code from Python 2 to Python 3 or you can even specify a version of Python 3

Also black/blue and flake8/pylint afterwards

video has lots of examples of how things have changed between Python 2 and Python 3
