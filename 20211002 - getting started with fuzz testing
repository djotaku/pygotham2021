All code has errors, but how many of those errors become bugs?

How do we keep a bug from leading to failure?

Heartbleed Bug - overflow bug based on asking a server for more characters than it has

Be prepared for the unexpected. There maybe infinite possibilities, your users will have no piety, no one may write a bug report

Fuzz Testing - use unexpected and random data to see how the system reacts

Tools for doing this:
- Microsoft RAFT - can only test on code running on MS Azure
- Google Atheris - unit test focused
- Artillery.io - written in Javascript

They didn't find a tool they wanted to use, so made their own

repo called Big list of naughty strings - gives you strings you can use for fuzzing

their tool is call Ahem and it will fuzz on the network
