How we dealt with poor code analysis support in our generator, metaclasses, and code generation heavy projects

IDE stops working with proper hints once you put a decorator on your function. Why?

Well, in his decorator function the wrapper takes *args and **kwargs. is this why? no.

Problem is that IDE is doing static anylysis.

To fix this requires very careful coding of the decorator.

Sometimes the code is just too complex and you cannot make it work within your decorator. But you can use stub files (PEP-484) to provide the typing information.
