Between each step of building datapoints should be considered to be a potential failure point

Cost of Poor data quality includes the fact that it's time consuming to fix and that bad business decisions can be made

One recc from the speaker is to use TDD and test at each potential failure point including before sending off to production use

What you test for depends on what's core to your business or group

Eg: We might need to make sure we're not introducing duplicates into our data. We can write tests to check for duplicates

Remember that testing is hard to get started, but once it gets going, it's pretty easy and will save time/cost
