Graphs for Data Science with NetworkX

Begins with graph terminilogy definted by using example of US contiguous US flight data.

Second example is to use OpenStreetMap to find the shortest distance from A to B

NetworkX object allows us to manipulate graphs (see code on page)

OpenStreetMap data also has bearing and that allows us to know if we're turning left or right

So you can combine OSM data and Djikstra's Algorithm to make a basic set of "GPS" directions

Final demo is graph connectivity and BitCoin

BitCoin transactions can be viewed as a directed weighted graph with the in/out being the money going back and forth as part of the transaction
