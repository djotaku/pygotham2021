This library allwos for Audio analysis and classicifation. 

You can also clean audio with this library.

ML at a high level
1. Data collection
2. Data cleaning and pre-processing
3. Transform data into numerical representation

Audio sends pressure waves that are interpreted by the brain.

There are great MATLAB tools to process audio

Two important terms:
- Spectrum - audio in the frequency domain
- Cepstrum - Log magnitude of spectrum and reverse fourier transform

Our ear is a natural fourier transform analyzer

MFCC - mel frequency cepstral coefficients - important way of visualizing audio

So you can use it to classify audio - is this audio from an urban setting, for example
